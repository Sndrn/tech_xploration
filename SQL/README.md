# What I've learned
## Major commands
For this certification I learned to use the following commands on existing databases in order to get an expected output (extracted data) from precise instructions & conditions :

### SELECT 
Extracts data from a database
### FROM 
Identify the name of the database
### WHERE 
The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
 
- =	Equal	
- >	Greater than	
- <	Less than	
- >=	Greater than or equal	
- <=	Less than or equal	
- <>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
- BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
- LIKE	Search for a pattern	
- IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

Syntax :
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
